# Linear
 Linear file structure ingest library

[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Linear.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Linear/) ![.NET Core](https://github.com/Lucina/Linear/workflows/.NET%20Core/badge.svg)

This library uses structure specification files to read
structured data from files. It is built for .NET Standard 2.0.

The command-line program [lyn](src/lyn) provides a simpe means for using
a structure file to lay out an input file and dump its outputs.

Usage: `lyn <structureFile> <inputFile> <outputDir>`

For structure file examples, see [the sample folder](sample).
Also check [the grammar file](spec/Linear.g4) which has comments for significant elements.

Builds for .NET Core 3.1 (requires [runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1)) and .NET Framework 4.7.2 are generated by [this workflow.](https://github.com/Lucina/Linear/actions)

[ANTLR4](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4) generates the structure file parser.
